## TV-Show-Analysis

# Problem Statement  

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of TV shows using Python. The visualizations help identify trends, such as whether ratings follow a normal distribution or have significant outliers.  
  
The dataset includes ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, as well as platform availability on Netflix and Prime Video.  

# Objectives  

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Loading and cleaning the dataset by removing unnecessary columns.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Visualizing the distribution of IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings.  
  - Analyzing the availability of TV shows on Netflix and Prime Video.
 
- **Streaming Platform Availability:**  
    - Creating bar charts to compare the number of TV shows available on **Netflix** and **Prime Video**.  
    - This visualization provides insights into the dominance of each platform in terms of content availability. 

# Tools & Libraries Used  

- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization  
- Executed in **Google Colab**, with data stored in **Google Drive**  

This project provides insights into the distribution of TV show ratings and their availability across streaming platforms.
